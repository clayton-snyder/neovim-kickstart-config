~* gray out disabled macro blocks
* TELESCOPe MENU:
    * Rezisable!
    * transparent turn on and off! Or hide, so you can see underneath. Gotta be able to read behind...
    * Border and such
    * Quit sanely
    * Maybe a menu of search types, instead of all the crazy leaders? Or just standardize
* commands for regenerating compile_commands.json and restarting clangd
* how the heck do I use autocomplete
* get stupid install stuff working
* fzf for dirs?
* show full filepath! somewhere!
* Telescope picker for various Siglo dirs. Programs, ssl, etc.
* new color scheme. telescope picker for colorschemes, switch
* add back symbols for whitespace
* flash.nvim!
* snippets for:
    - module/desc fmt string
    - module/desc calls on result
* colorful-menu.nvim!
* STANDARDIZE ON ESC TO EXIT THINGS. YAZI ETC.
* Make a list of commands to start using more
* Env vars for common rel paths from Programs to ssl 
* rice flash
* rice harpoon. can I have diff harpoon lists? maybe one for todo? add from search/livegrep windows?
    * default list of waypoints in Siglo sdk
* NEED FIND FILES IN SSL. NOT FIND FILES WITH. in general get searching locked down
* how to operate in search menus? Need to be able to add to lists, etc.
* improve the bufferlines

experiment:
* maybe a vertical bufferline? maybe not. but having it horizontal makes it confusing to track
  which split it's open in. think "buffer all the way on the right" and split on the left. Maybe 
  order the buffer "tabs" like a stack? currently open always on the far left, recents after?

terminal:
* env vars: siglo base, ssl base, nss/openssl, tests, samples, process list dirs
* aliases: common nact builds (snippets DWM style?), flashes
* misc snips: serial numbers


linux:
* move siglo-wsl.sh somewhere else so it doesn't get committed
* need to figure out the path for nact and other tools. Oh yeah we're missing tools from the path LMAO
* What's the "why"?
* when in siglo, alias git to git.exe
